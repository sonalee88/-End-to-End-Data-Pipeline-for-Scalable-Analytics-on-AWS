# -End-to-End-Data-Pipeline-for-Scalable-Analytics-on-AWS
📌 Overview
This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline on AWS to process and analyze sales data efficiently. It extracts raw data from Amazon RDS (MySQL), transforms it using AWS Glue, and loads it into Amazon S3 for scalable storage. Amazon Athena enables fast SQL-based queries, and Jupyter Notebook provides interactive visualizations.

🎯 Features
✅ ETL Pipeline with AWS Glue – Processes 500K+ sales records efficiently.
✅ Optimized Storage & Querying – Transformed data stored in Amazon S3, reducing query execution time by 40%.
✅ Scalable Architecture – Leverages AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, RDS, IAM, Lambda) for seamless data processing.
✅ Interactive Visualizations – Built with Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for business insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Cloud: AWS (S3, Glue, Athena, RDS, IAM, Lambda)
Data Processing: Python, Pandas, AWS Wrangler
Database: MySQL (Amazon RDS)
Querying & Analytics: Amazon Athena
Visualization: Jupyter Notebook, Seaborn, Matplotlib
📌 Architecture
1️⃣ Extract – Sales data ingested from Amazon RDS (MySQL).
2️⃣ Transform – AWS Glue cleans and prepares the data.
3️⃣ Load – Transformed data stored in Amazon S3.
4️⃣ Query & Analyze – Amazon Athena enables SQL-based querying.
5️⃣ Visualize – Jupyter Notebook creates interactive reports.

🚀 How to Run
🔹 Prerequisites
AWS account with permissions for S3, Glue, Athena, and RDS
Python environment with required libraries (pip install pandas awswrangler seaborn matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook for visualization
🔹 Steps to Deploy
1️⃣ Set up Amazon RDS (MySQL) and load raw sales data.
2️⃣ Create an S3 bucket to store transformed data.
3️⃣ Configure AWS Glue for ETL processing.
4️⃣ Use Amazon Athena to query transformed data.
5️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook to generate insights and visualizations.

📊 Sample Queries (Amazon Athena)
sql

Edit
-- Get total sales per country
SELECT country, SUM(sales) AS total_sales 
FROM sales_data 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Find top 5 best-selling products
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity 
FROM sales_data 
GROUP BY product_name 
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC 
LIMIT 5;
